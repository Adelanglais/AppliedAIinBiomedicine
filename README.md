## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is composed of 15470 X-Ray images, stored in PNG or JPEG format. These images come from healthy patients, patients with pneumonia or tuberculosis. A .csv file allows the name of a specific file to be associated with the class to which it belongs.  
The dataset is unbalanced according to the class distribution which is as follows: 9354 images for the normal patients, 4250 for the pneumonia patients, and 1866 for the tuberculosis patients.
